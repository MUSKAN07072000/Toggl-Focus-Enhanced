Pain Points Addressed
Missing Feature Controls

Users cannot edit completed focus sessions, set advanced session durations, or customize their notification preferences within Toggl Focus, limiting control over their workflow and productivity needs.

Functionality Gaps

Toggl Focus lacks integration with key Toggl products (Track, Plan), advanced analytics for session data, multi-project handling, and flexible grouping of tasks.

The absence of session recovery after accidental closure or browser crashes results in data loss and frustration.

User Onboarding Barriers

New users find the platform challenging to navigate due to limited onboarding guidance, lack of contextual help, and insufficient explanations of feature benefits or workflows.

Power users have no guided means to explore advanced capabilities, resulting in underutilization.

Solutions Implemented
Feature Controls:

Added the ability for users to edit, delete, and merge focus sessions.

Implemented customizable session durations and adjustable break intervals, supporting popular productivity methods like Pomodoro and Deep Work.

Developed advanced notification management, allowing users to personalize reminders for session start, end, and breaks.

Closing Functionality Gaps:

Integrated Toggl Focus with Toggl Track and Toggl Plan using official APIs for seamless data sync and reporting.

Introduced project and task grouping features, task labeling, and multi-session management directly from the dashboard.

Enabled session data autosave and recovery, preventing loss from accidental tab/browser closures or system crashes.

Added session analytics: productivity trends, focus time distribution, and easy export for reviews and team reporting.

Enhancing Onboarding Experience:

Developed an interactive onboarding flow with guided tours, tooltips, animated walkthroughs, and contextual checklists for new users.

Created an “advanced setup” wizard for power users to explore and customize all available features.

Provided in-app feedback modules and quick links to support documentation, community forums, and video tutorials.

End Result
All new features and improvements adhere to Toggl’s established UI patterns: minimal, clean, pastel-themed, with clear visual cues and responsive components.

The enhanced onboarding makes it easy and inviting for anyone to get started—while power users have the tools to delve deeper.

Integrated feedback and recovery modules ensure users’ data and workflow are protected and continuously improved.

The Toggl Focus experience becomes robust, adaptable, and delightfully simple—helping individuals and teams reclaim their productivity.
